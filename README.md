# ChatBot-JU  
Custom chatbot for Jönköping's University

This is a customized chatbot tailored for Jönköping's University. The UI includes feedback buttons for each response from the chatbot (thumb up/down). When the user clicks on the feedback button, the feedback is collected and sent along with the query to an API for collecting feedbacks.  
Every QA pair is sent to a reality check API which responds back with an assessment score that indicates how factually correct the response is.
